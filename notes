My HTML5 challenge: Robot Sentry: styled after the original inspiration for
tower defense games, the second Aliens movie and Lemmings.
The game starts out with an attract mode like 80's style arcade games. Should
be able to move forward in sequence or click on any element to play that
attract element or pause/play.  Show press any key to insert coins, play in
all attract elements.  Should show copyright all the time.  In this order and
loops around:
- title sequence
- Backstory
- Example of gameplay, 1 of 10 different examples.
- Instructions on how to play with examples shown on the side
  - list of aliens and behaviors
  - list of mazes
  - list of remote sentries
  - list of sentry upgrades and behaviors
- high scores
- credits
- PSA on not using drugs.  Losers use drugs.  Winners play computer games.

At top center have a login system with passcodes.  They are auto-generated,
unique, and serve as both username and password.  You can attach other
information to them or not.  There will be buttons for dealing with account
information and the passcode system.  The passcode will be saved to your
browser's cookie collection.
- display the passcode
- generate a new passcode for this same account.  It's generated because the
main problem with usernames and passwords is that people often use the same
passwords for everything.  Not a very secure practice.  This eliminates that
problem.
- copy to clipboard, so you can paste it into a different browser on the
same or a different computer.
- add account info
With this system you can play a game, and it will remember your session
without the need for you to provide any personal information.

menu system on the right side or in the center. Choose the style of maze:
orthogonal (rectangular shape with square passages, sigma (rectangular outer
shape with hexagonal passages), delta (rectangular outer shape with
triangular passages), triangular shape with triangular passages, hexagonal
shape with hexagonal passages
- press splash to show the attract mode starting with the splash page
"cinematic"

Then choose from 10 levels of complexity for a total of 50 different maps

display number of aliens reaching exit.  When 100 of each kind of alien has
been released and there is a slot for a new one to be release it will release
the next level alien.  That way there will be a mixture of alien types
simultaneously.
10 colored sentries for 10 different kinds each one more useful for defence.
Each one can be upgraded but the upgrade kits are limited in supply.

Karate belts to rank maps aliens, sentries and upgrades: white, yellow,
orange, green, blue, purple, brown, red, black, pink - total bad-ass, The pink
level alien is ONE queen which is bad-ass and protected by all the other
aliens.

Some sentries fire explosives which can either damage the walls, destroy them,
make them dynamic, floating.  This persists to the last.
Some ammo pushes the aliens back
some ammo pulls them forward
some sentries attract some aliens
some repel them
some sentries can move and have AI
some sentries can use more than one kind of ammo.
Ammo runs out and needs to be reloaded which takes time and money and can't
function while that's happening
There is a limited supply of each kind of ammo even though you are paying for
it
some ammo ricochets against the walls until it finds an alien.
some ammo goes through walls.
You buy the ammo in specific lots of 5 or 10.

Each sentry shows damage and ammo level
sentries which are 50% damages become totally incapacitated but still
reparable sentries which are 100% damaged are not cost-effective to repair
sentries which are between 1 and 50% damaged will malfunction in some way
repairing sentries costs time and money, and they can not be used during
upgrading sentries costs time and money ditto
aliens damage the sentries, how much?  It depends on the sentry and the alien.
You can hit repair on a sentry simply to relocate it.  If it is 0% damaged it
does not cost anything but time.

animatable canvas elements: lines, rects, paths, texts

lots of reverberation
modern symphony music, sad and suspenseful
What year is it supposed to be? 2179

- nuke the colony!  Once you think you have lost, all or most colonists killed
or cocooned, if you leave the colony there someone will want to rescue them
thus allowing the aliens to seed somewhere else.  Also, if the queen might
survive, so you might as well nuke it!  The more colonist die the fewer points
you have. There should be some incentive to nuking the colony at the end of
the game if you are not going to win it.  It will be cool and when you nuke
it will optimize to your game points.

- limit the number of aliens at any one time, say 100.  If one escapes or is
killed then another will come.
- aliens which are killed turn into x's and do not move but still block
- Why does a future space colony have a maze in front of their front door?
For security.  People who grow up there learn to navigate the maze pretty
quickly.  There's always someone at the front to guide people through the
maze if they are visitors.  Also, it's way more defensible especially if you
can drop remote sentries anywhere into it.

Similar to sentries if an alien is damaged 50% it becomes incapacitated, they
will turn slowly into x's instead of 0's.  If it
is damaged 1-49% it will not behave optimally.  If it becomes damaged 100%
it will have another counter where it degrades and after an amount of time
its extent will become radius 0 and be removed from the game area but will
leave behind a stain which persists to the end of the game.  The color of the
alien is the color of the stain left behind.  Like blood stains that
accumulate.  By the end of the game it should be a big gorey mess.  Cool.

Limited number of upgrade kits and types of upgrades, limited amount of ammo,
limited number of sentries.  They can become damaged during attack.  The can
become damaged beyond repair also.  Limited number of technicians with
different areas of expertise.

Different sentries use potentially different kinds of ammo.  Some that use
power can have a tether which provides them with unlimited power but the
tether can become damaged.  I would say something like 5 different kinds of
ammo.

backstory

[A message from the ministry of colonial defense to prospective colonial defenders]

In this year of 2179, as you already know, colonies on and off world are protected by maze complexes,
which are the only entrances or exits to or from the colony.  The inhabitants of the colonies grow up
knowing the maze which presents no challenge to them.  However any non-colonists need a colonist
guide.  These were put in place to provide compact bottlenecks where remote sentries can be deployed.
Remote sentries, upgrades, repair kits, and ammunition are stocked but not unlimited.

As a colonial defender it's your task to be strategic about where, when, and which sentries to deploy.
There are many different kinds of aliens with a great variety of behaviors.  If you fail, colonists
will be injured, killed, some cocooned, and potentially become host to more aliens.  They can then
escape in order to infect other colonies.  If the colony is lost you are authorized, in fact ordered,
to destroy all.  It's the only way to make sure.  You of course will sadly meet your own demise in
such an unlikely and unfortunate scenario, but your sacrifice will not be forgotten.

We have provided you with this simulation as a training tool to practice the management of these
costly defence resources.  If you show skill in this we will gladly employ you as a colonial defender,
a highly esteemed and lucrative position in colonial governments.

Good luck.

I need to remove every trace of Aliens references from the whole thing.  If this
takes off, the people who own the IP for Aliens will come knocking on the door
and demand payment.  Besides that it's not like I lack any imagination to fail
to produce my own ideas and content.  It's lame and sell-out to use other
people's ideas, even if you do get away with it.
